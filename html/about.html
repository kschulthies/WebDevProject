                                <p>I was born in Rexburg, Idaho and moved to a small, little farm town right on the Oregon-Idaho border by the time I was one.
                                    My father, uncle, and grandpa were partners on a farming corporation and grew onions, sugarbeets, corn, wheat, and other crops.
                                    As I am sure you have guessed, I spent my childhood helping out in whatever way I could. When I was younger that meant fixing leaks in the drip tape.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="indent">
                                <p>With age I was trusted with more until I was leading a weeding crew during the summer to help manage the fields. I also switched water from different sections of the fields and did other tasks that came up.
                                    My mom worked hard to make sure I did things other than farm. Throughout my life I have participated in dance, swimming, gymnastics, soccer, basketball, volleyball, softball, track, and XC.
                                    Within school I was involved with a few different clubs such as SMILE (Science Math Investigative Learning Experience), FFA (Future Farmers of America), National Honors Society, and Student Council.

                            <div class="indent">
                                <p>My upbringing has really influenced who I am and what I want to do with my life. Right now I am planning on majoring in either finance or accounting and to gain as much knowledge as possible 
                                    so that I can help those who have helped me become who I am. I want to be able to come and educate farmers and so many others from small rural areas on good practices and better ways to manage their money.
                                    Another goal of mine is to travel; to see other places on this Earth and learn about other cultures and people. The world is so wide and I want to see as much of it as I can.
                                </p>

                            <div class="indent">
                                <p>With time, I have learned more about myself, my goals, and my values. Since coming to college I have discovered just how important it is to know what you stand for; what you value.
                                <p>What motivates you? What makes you happy? What is essential?</p>
                                <p>I have thought a lot about those questions this past year and this is what I have learned. What motivates me is helping others. Being the oldest, I've spent a lot of time caring for and helping them with everything from car rides to homework.
                                    When I serve others, I forget my problems and learn to love those around me. What makes me happy besides serving is being with loved ones and doin things that I enjoy. My time away from my family has taught me just how much I value them.
                                    What is essential for me is the gospel and my relationship with Christ. When I have a strong relationship with him I am at peace and know that I can handle whatever comes my way.
